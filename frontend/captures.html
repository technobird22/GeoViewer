        <h2 class=" section-header">About GeoCapture</h2>
        GeoCapture takes your satellite images and adds some spice. (And maybe a few herbs, too!), to make them as absolutely beautiful as possible.
      </p>
        GeoCap primarily uses raw data from Geo-Kompsat-2A (GK-2A), a satellite in geosynchrenous orbit approximately 35,786km away.
        GK-2A takes images of the Earth every 10 minutes in 16 different wavelengths (including but not limited to Visual and Infrared) and
        transmits those images back down to Earth via LRIT, which is recieved and then demodulated into images.
        Many other types of images from this data stream can also be decoded, but the images we're interested in what are called full disk images.
        Full disk images are images taken from the perspective of the satellite, which shows one side of the Earth in all of its glory.
      </p>
        Now here's where those spices come in. The full disk images beamed down via LRIT are called IR105 images, which are infrared images, which come out as black and white.
        Sounds rather boring, doesn't it? That's what GeoCap is here to solve. GeoCap takes those images and brings out details that couldn't be seen before, colours them,
        sharpens them as well as overlays data and animates them to make them as interesting as possible, all without you having to lift a finger. (for the most part).
